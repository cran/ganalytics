\usage{
sequential_segment(steps)
}
\arguments{
\item{steps}{a list of expressions (of one or more conditions), each
repeating a step in the sequence.}
}
\description{
Create a sequence using non-standard evaluation syntax.
}
\details{
Steps must be separated by commas (\code{,}). \code{...} denotes zero or more
interactions may precede the step that follows, otherwise without \code{...} then
the there must not be any interactions between the adjacent steps in order for the
results to match the sequence.

\examples{
a <- Expr(~pagePath == "/home")
b <- Expr(~eventCategory == "Video") &
  Expr(~eventAction == "Play")
c <- Expr(~medium == "email")
