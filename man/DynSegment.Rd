\usage{
DynSegment(object, ..., name = character(0))

\S4method{DynSegment}{ANY}(object, ..., name = character(0))

\S4method{DynSegment}{gaDynSegment}(object)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{The first filter to include in the segment definition.}

\item{...}{Additional filters to include in the segment definition, if
needed.}

\item{name}{An optional name given to the dynamic segment.}

\value{
a gaDynSegment object.
}
\description{
Combine one or more segment condition filters and/or sequence filters into a
gaDynSegment that is scoped to either 'user' or 'session' level.
}
\details{
A segment filter is either sequential or non-sequential conditions.
Sequential and non-sequential conditions can be combined using this function.
