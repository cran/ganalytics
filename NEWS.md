# ganalytics 2018-06-23

* Version type dimensions, e.g. ga:appVersion, are now coerced to `numeric_version` class, so that version numbers (e.g. ‘2.4.7’, ‘2.5.13’, ‘2.32.1’, etc...) can be correctly sorted and compared as if they were numeric values. Updated gademo.R.
* The dateRange class now inherits 'lubridate' interval as its superclass.
* It is now possible to query more than 10 metrics with just one query.

# ganalytics 2018-05-30

* Additional methods to coerce ganalytics segment classes and table filters for use with the 'googleAnalyticsR' package.

* Updated `googleAnalyticsR-demo` and examples in the readme file.

# ganalytics 2018-02-18

* Added methods for coercing a range of ganalytics classes into 'googleAnalyticsR' classes, so that ganalytics segments, filters and expressions can be used by the google_analytics function of the 'googleAnalyticsR' package.

# ganalytics 2018-02-12

* Scope and negation of segment conditions can now be defined at the filter level.
* Fixed bug where backslashes were being escaped incorrectly in expression operands.
* The methods of the Segment generic function are now split into two generic functions, Segment and Segments.
* Segments is used to set or get a named list segments, whereas Segment is for defining a single segment to be added to a Segments list.

# ganalytics 2017-12-27

* Support for %starts_with% and %ends_with% operators in addition to %contains% which was incorrectly described as %starts_with% previously.

# ganalytics 2015-12-12

# ganalytics 2015-09-18

* PerUser and PerSession can now be used instead of SegmentFilters to create a scoped segment filter list. Also, Include and Exclude have been added to add include and exclude (i.e negate) filters to a segment definition, rather than needing to use the negate argument of the Sequence and SegmentConditionFilter functions.
* Added function for generating a segment definition from a list where ... can be used to mean 'followed-by / Later' prior to the next step in the sequence. Note this function uses non-standard evaluation.
* PerHit can be used to transform a condition filter into a sequence of length one, which offers a powerful form of segmentation where all conditions must be met for a single hit rather than scoped across sessions or users.
* Expr can now be used with a formula denoted by the prefix `~`. This uses non-standard evaluation so that variable names and condition operators do not need to be surrounded by quotation marks.
* Added IsNegated generic function and method for testing whether a segment filter's negated slot is set to TRUE.

# ganalytics 2015-09-16

* Renamed segmentation functions: GaSequenceCondition -> Sequence; GaNonSequenceCondition -> SegmentConditionFilter; GaSegmentCondition -> SegmentFilters

# ganalytics 2015-09-15

* Renamed GaSequence to Sequence. Added PerUser, PerSession and PerHit generic functions for setting the scope of segment filters, and metrics conditions used within segments. Also, renamed GaScopeLevel and GaScopeLevel<- functions to ScopeLevel and ScopeLevel<- respectively.

* Authentication credentials are remembered between commands without the need for the user to store them in a local variable.
